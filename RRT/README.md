# About 
This project implements the algorithm of RRT.

## Points to Note
1. The obstacles have been deterministically placed in the environment
2. Shortest path in the graph is calculated using BFS
3. The code also outputs total path length in unit distance and time taken to execute the code


## Path: 1st Environment
