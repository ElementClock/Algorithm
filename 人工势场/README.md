# About
This folder has code for potential fields. The strength of the attraction (by goal) and repulsion (by obstacles) can be tweaked in the code. 

## Environment
The below plot shows the net potential field in the environment due to a goal and an obstacle:<br />
Green circle: start position<br />
Red circle: obstacle(s)<br />
Yellow circle: goal position<br />
